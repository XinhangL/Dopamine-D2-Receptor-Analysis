# 🧪 Dopamine D2 Receptor Drug Mechanism Analysis

This notebook analyzes a dataset of pharmaceutical compounds related to the Dopamine D2 receptor, a key target in neuroscience and psychiatric drug development.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Explore and summarize the mechanisms of action of compounds related to the Dopamine D2 receptor
- **Dataset**: CSV file with compound name, mechanism of action, receptor class, and more
- **Techniques**: Data cleansing, inspection, and preparation for grouped summaries

---

## 🧠 Key Techniques

- Data loading and delimiter handling with `pandas.read_csv()`
- Data inspection using `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()`
- String-based filtering using `str.contains()` and `.value_counts()`
- Setup of clean visual style with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
